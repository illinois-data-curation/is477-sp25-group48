# Final Project Status Report
So far, strong progress has been made on the project "Measuring the Impact of Remote Work on Transportation Emissions (Metro-Level Analysis 2022–2023)." To acquire the data, I created download_data.py, which automatically pulls the LEHD WFH dataset and the EPA MOVES emissions data into the /data folder. This script also generates SHA-256 checksum files (wfh_checksum.txt and epa_checksum.txt) to ensure the data's integrity. For integrating the datasets, I built integrate_data.py, which merges the two sources by standardizing metro area names and outputs a combined file, merged_data.csv. For profiling and assessing data quality, I developed profile_data.py, which produces descriptive statistics (data_profile.csv) and missing value reports (missing_values_report.csv) saved under /docs. All workflows are automated through a Makefile, making the project easily reproducible. These artifacts—datasets, scripts, and outputs—are organized neatly within /data, /src, and /docs in the repository.The timeline has been updated to reflect the current stage of each part of the project. Between April 3rd and April 7th, I successfully completed the tasks of automating data downloads, verifying checksums for data integrity, and setting up preliminary storage—all according to plan. From April 8th to April 14th, I'm working on data profiling, quality checking, initial cleaning, and generating preliminary statistics and visuals. These tasks are actively in progress and are on track to be finished by April 14th. Next, from April 15th to April 21st, I'll focus on packaging the scripts into an installable Python package and setting up the fully reproducible workflow. Writing the metadata and compiling final citations is scheduled for the last phase of the project between April 22nd and May 1st.

There have been a few minor adjustments based on what I’ve learned along the way. Originally, I thought profiling the data would be fairly straightforward after merging the datasets. However, I found that additional time was needed to create standalone missing value reports and dig deeper into the quality of the data, beyond just basic statistics. This extra step became important because early testing revealed inconsistencies between the EPA emissions metro naming conventions and those used by LEHD. Even with these small adjustments, there have been no major changes to the overall scope or timeline, and the project is still on schedule to be completed by May 1st.
